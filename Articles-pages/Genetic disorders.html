        <h1 class="title">Genetic Disorders</h1>
        <p>Genetic disorders are medical conditions caused by abnormalities in an individual's genetic material, typically resulting from mutations in specific genes or chromosomes. These disorders can be inherited from parents or occur spontaneously due to errors during DNA replication. While some genetic mutations may have minimal impact, others can lead to serious health problems, affecting both the physical and mental well-being of individuals. <br>
            One of the most well-known genetic disorders is Down syndrome, which arises from an extra copy of chromosome 21, a condition known as trisomy 21. People with Down syndrome typically exhibit characteristic facial features, developmental delays, and varying degrees of intellectual disability. Although the severity of symptoms can differ from person to person, individuals with Down syndrome often require specialized medical care and educational support to lead fulfilling lives. Advances in medical care have significantly improved the life expectancy and quality of life for people with Down syndrome. <br>
            Another common genetic disorder is cystic fibrosis (CF), a condition that primarily affects the lungs and digestive system. CF is caused by a mutation in the CFTR gene, which leads to the production of thick, sticky mucus that clogs airways and causes persistent respiratory infections. Over time, this can lead to lung damage and complications with other organs, including the pancreas. Though there is no cure for cystic fibrosis, ongoing medical treatments and therapies, such as chest physiotherapy and antibiotics, can help manage the symptoms and improve quality of life. <br>
            Huntington's disease, another significant genetic disorder, is a neurodegenerative condition caused by mutations in the HTT gene. This disease is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, meaning that a person only needs one copy of the mutated gene to develop the disorder. Huntington's disease is characterized by a gradual decline in motor control, cognitive function, and emotional stability, often manifesting later in life, typically between the ages of 30 and 50. As the disease progresses, individuals may experience uncontrollable movements, difficulty with speech and swallowing, and severe changes in personality and mental health. Unfortunately, Huntington's disease is currently incurable, and treatment primarily focuses on alleviating symptoms and improving quality of life. <br>
            The study of genetic disorders plays a crucial role in modern medicine, as it allows scientists and healthcare professionals to understand the underlying causes of these conditions and develop targeted treatments. Genetic research has led to groundbreaking advances, such as gene therapy, which holds the potential to treat or even cure certain genetic disorders by correcting faulty genes. Additionally, genetic testing and counseling have become essential tools in identifying individuals who are at risk of passing on genetic disorders to their offspring, allowing for more informed decisions about family planning and prenatal care. <br>
            Raising awareness about genetic disorders is equally important, as it helps reduce stigma, increases support for affected individuals, and promotes the need for continued research and innovation in the field. By understanding the genetic basis of these conditions, society can work towards improving the lives of those affected and developing new treatments that may one day prevent or cure these disorders altogether. <br>
