        <h1 class="title">Nervous System</h1>
        <p>The nervous system is a complex and highly organized network that is essential for our survival, enabling us to process and respond to internal and external stimuli. This intricate system is divided into two main parts: the central nervous system (CNS), which comprises the brain and spinal cord, and the peripheral nervous system (PNS), which includes all the nerves that branch out from the brain and spinal cord to other parts of the body. Together, they control everything from basic physiological functions like breathing to complex processes such as thinking, feeling, and moving. <br>

            A healthy nervous system is vital for maintaining homeostasis and overall well-being. However, several diseases can disrupt its normal functioning, leading to significant health challenges. Among the most common and impactful diseases affecting the nervous system are stroke, multiple sclerosis, and Alzheimer's disease. <br>
            
            A stroke occurs when the blood supply to part of the brain is interrupted or reduced, preventing brain tissue from getting oxygen and nutrients. This can cause brain cells to die within minutes. There are two main types of strokes: ischemic, caused by a blockage in an artery, and hemorrhagic, caused by a blood vessel bursting. The effects of a stroke can be devastating, often leading to long-term disability or death. Early detection and prompt treatment are crucial, as they can significantly improve the outcome and reduce the risk of permanent damage. <br>
            
            Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease that affects the central nervous system, particularly the brain and spinal cord. It occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks the protective sheath (myelin) that covers nerve fibers, causing communication problems between the brain and the rest of the body. Symptoms of MS can vary widely but often include fatigue, difficulty walking, numbness or tingling, muscle weakness, and problems with coordination and balance. While there is currently no cure for MS, early diagnosis and treatment can help manage symptoms, slow the progression of the disease, and improve the quality of life for those affected. <br>
            
            Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that is the most common cause of dementia in older adults. It is characterized by the gradual decline in cognitive function, memory loss, and changes in behavior and personality. The exact cause of Alzheimer's is not fully understood, but it is believed to involve a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors that affect the brain over time. Early detection of Alzheimer's disease is essential, as it allows for early intervention that can help manage symptoms, provide support for patients and caregivers, and potentially slow the progression of the disease. <br>
            
            The importance of early detection and treatment in these and other neurological conditions cannot be overstated. Early diagnosis often leads to better management of the disease, improved outcomes, and a higher quality of life for patients. Advances in medical research and technology continue to improve our understanding of the nervous system and the diseases that affect it, offering hope for more effective treatments and, ultimately, cures. Recognizing the signs and symptoms of these conditions and seeking prompt medical attention can make a significant difference in the lives of those affected. <br>
