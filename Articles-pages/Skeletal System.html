        <h1 class="title">Skeletal System</h1>
        <p>The skeletal system is a remarkable framework that provides structure and support to the human body. Comprising 206 bones in adults, it not only serves as a scaffold for the body's shape but also protects vital organs, anchors muscles, and stores essential minerals. The bones themselves are dynamic tissues that undergo continuous remodeling throughout a person's life, balancing the activities of bone formation and resorption to maintain strength and integrity. <br>
            Maintaining bone health is crucial for overall well-being, as various diseases can compromise the skeletal system's function and structure. Osteoporosis, for example, is a condition characterized by weakened bones that are more susceptible to fractures. This disease often progresses silently, without symptoms until a bone breaks, making it especially insidious. Factors contributing to osteoporosis include aging, hormonal changes, inadequate nutrition, and a sedentary lifestyle. Preventive measures such as a diet rich in calcium and vitamin D, regular weight-bearing exercise, and lifestyle modifications can significantly reduce the risk of developing osteoporosis. <br>
            Another common affliction is arthritis, which encompasses over 100 different types of joint diseases and conditions. The most prevalent forms are osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease resulting from wear and tear on the joints, typically affecting older adults. Rheumatoid arthritis, on the other hand, is an autoimmune disorder where the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the joints, causing inflammation and pain. Both conditions can severely impact mobility and quality of life, highlighting the importance of early diagnosis and comprehensive management strategies, including medication, physical therapy, and lifestyle adjustments. <br>
            Bone cancer, although less common, is a serious condition that can originate in the bones or spread to them from other parts of the body. Primary bone cancers, such as osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma, primarily affect children and young adults, while metastatic bone cancers are more prevalent in older adults. Treatment options for bone cancer often involve a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy, tailored to the individual patient's needs. <br>
            Overall, the significance of maintaining bone health cannot be overstated. Healthy bones are fundamental to a person's mobility, stability, and overall quality of life. Regular exercise, a balanced diet rich in bone-supporting nutrients, and routine medical check-ups are essential components of a proactive approach to preserving skeletal health. By prioritizing these habits, individuals can significantly reduce their risk of developing debilitating bone diseases and ensure a robust and resilient skeletal system throughout their lives.</p>
