                        <p class="item-summ">Genetic disorders are medical conditions caused by abnormalities in an
                            individual's genetic material, typically resulting from mutations in specific genes or
                            chromosomes. These disorders can be inherited from parents or occur spontaneously due to
                            errors during DNA replication. While some genetic mutations may have minimal impact, others
                            can lead to serious health problems, affecting both the physical and mental well-being of
                            individuals.</p>

                            United States. Coronary heart disease is a type of
                            heart disease where the arteries of the heart cannot
                            deliver enough oxygen-rich blood to the heart. It is
                            also sometimes called coronary artery disease or
                            ischemic heart disease.

                            Myocardial infarction is the scientific name for
                            the condition that is known as heart attack. A
                            myocardial infarction is a medical case where the
                            heart muscle begins to die due to the lake of
                            blood flow reaching to it. This lack of blood flow
                            can occur because of many different factors but
                            mostly from the blockage that may happen in the
                            arteries that supports the heart. Also, a
                            myocardial infarction can cause permanent heart
                            damage and death.

                            Arrhythmia is when the heart rate increases or slows down and the reason for this case is
                            the
                            change in the electrical system of the heart or a short circuit in the heart this causes the
                            heart
                            not to pump blood in a good way Which leads to poor blood circulation in the body.

                            A stroke occurs when the blood supply to part of
                            the brain is interrupted. Consequently, brain cells
                            die rapidly. There are two types: ischemic stroke,
                            which is caused by a blood clot blocking a vessel;
                            and hemorrhagic stroke, caused by a rupture in a
                            blood vessel. Also, there is a transient ischemic
                            attack, a temporary blockage, often called a "mini
                            stroke," which increases future risk. That therefore means that immediate
                            treatment is very essential for survival and recovery
